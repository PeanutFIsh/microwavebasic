                <h3>Welcome to the <pink>MicrowaveBASIC Homepage!</pink></h3>
                
                <h3>[<a href="#FEATURES">Features</a> || <a href="#SMOLGUIDE">SmolGuide™</a> || <a href="#DOWNLOAD">Download</a>]</h3><br>
                <cyan>MicrowaveBASIC</cyan> is a simple and open source BASIC Interpreter written in C++. Currently in ALPHA, the programming language is very limited.<br>
                This is also the first ever C++ project I am working on. (lmao I am litterally learning the language at the same time I code this so expect stuff like bad optimization)<br>
                <br>This is also a part of a project I am currently working on. Once done, the project will be introduced on youtube and an embed video will be shown on this page<br>
                <br><h3>What's the <pink>purpose</pink> of it?</h3>
                
                The purpose of <cyan>MicrowaveBASIC</cyan> is to remake an entire BASIC Interpreter working on a <pink>CLI (command-line interface)</pink>. This project is written on Linux (and partially on Windows) and is designed to work on a Linux terminal.
                <br>The interpreter is supposed to work like <pink>80s computers</pink> (with the 10, 20, 30, etc.) 
                
                <h1 id="FEATURES"><pink>FEATURES</pink></h1>

                <h3>Retro 80s style interpreter</h3>
                As it's purpose is, the MicrowaveBASIC Interpreter is supposed to work like a 80s micro-computer BASIC Interpreter. That means you will type your code in the interpreter like this :
                
                <div class="code">
                    10 P "Hello, World!"<br>
                    20 G 10<br>
                    RUN
                </div>

                <h3>Fully written from scratch</h3>
                The entire code is written in C++ and <pink>from scratch</pink>. Nothing of the source code (except one utils.cpp function) has been copied from other websites.<br>
                The entire code including the string, math and condition expression system, the engine and the interpreter has been entirely coded by me.

                <h3>Simple expression system... probably too simple</h3>
                Writing conditions and expressions with MicrowaveBASIC is simple but also very limited. (that's a con)<br>
                <div class="code">
                    // GOOD
                    <br>IF A=1:P "A = 1"
                    <br>// BAD
                    <br>IF A==1:P "A = 1"
                    <br>
                    <br>// GOOD
                    <br>=* A 1+2-3
                    <br>// BAD (does not support parentheses)
                    <br>=* A (1+2)-3 
                </div>

                Yea... It doesn't support parentesis and you can only use + - * / operators<br>
                Same for strings, very limited, you can only add strings<br><br>
                But <pink>no worries!</pink> I am planning to rewrite the expression system!

                <h3>Nani?</h3>
                MicrowaveBASIC SmolGuide™ is a small guide that will make you know this language in a few minutes of reading.<br>

                <h3>0. how tf do i use the interpreter?</h3>
                Like any 80s micro-computer. <br>
                <smolcode>NEW</smolcode> to clear the program<br>
                <smolcode>LIST</smolcode> to check your program<br>
                <smolcode>RUN</smolcode> to run your program<br>
                <smolcode>(NUMBER) (LINE OF CODE)</smolcode> to add a line of code in your program.<br><br>
                <smolcode>SAVE</smolcode> and <smolcode>LOAD</smolcode> are gonna be added later.

                <h3>1. Can I have an overview?</h3>
                Let's give you an overview of the programming language with a small code that I am going to explain. If you don't have the time or you are not interrested of the overview, you can skip to the chapter 2.<br>
                <div class='code'>
                    10 p "Hello! What's your name? "
                    <br>20 ?$ A
                    <br>30 I$ A="":G 60
                    <br>40 I$ A!"":P "Hello, " + A + "! Nice to meet you!"
                    <br>50 G 80
                    <br>60 p "Looks like you typed nothing, please enter your name. "
                    <br>70 G 20
                </div>

                Now let me explain this code.<br><br>
                <div class='code'>10 p "Hello! What's your name? "</div>
                This first line of code will <pink>print</pink> some text asking your name <pink>without line break</pink>. <smol>(see p command in Chapter 2)</smol><br><br>

                <div class='code'>20 ?$ A</div>
                This command (?$) will let you <pink>type anything and will input what you typed.</pink> (INPUT$ in most of BASIC interpreters) and will store it in the variable A. <smol>(see ? command in Chapter 2)</smol><br><br>

                <div class='code'>30 I$ A="":G 60</div>
                <pink>If</pink> the string A is equal to "" (if you typed nothing), then the program will <pink>jump to line 60</pink> <smol>(see I command and G command in Chapter 2)</smol><br><br>

                <div class='code'>40 I$ A:"":P "Hello, " + A + "! Nice to meet you!"</div>
                If you actually typed something, the program will tell you "Hello, (name)! Nice to meet you!" <smol>(see P command in Chapter 2 and string expressions in Chapter 3)</smol><br><br>

                <div class='code'>50 G 80</div>
                This will just gonna take you to the end of the program, making it end.<br><br>

                <div class='code'>60 p "Looks like you typed nothing, please enter your name. "<br>70 G 20</div>
                This is the code that is gonna be run if you type nothing when will go back to the line 20 to ask your name again.
