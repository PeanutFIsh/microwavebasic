                <h3>Welcome to the <pink>MicrowaveBASIC Homepage!</pink></h3>
                <cyan>MicrowaveBASIC</cyan> is a simple and open source BASIC Interpreter written in C++. Currently in ALPHA, the programming language is very limited.<br>
                This is also the first ever C++ project I am working on. (lmao I am litterally learning the language at the same time I code this so expect stuff like bad optimization)<br>
                <br>This is also a part of a project I am currently working on. Once done, the project will be introduced on youtube and an embed video will be shown on this page<br>
                

                <br><h3>What's the <pink>purpose</pink> of it?</h3>
                
                The purpose of <cyan>MicrowaveBASIC</cyan> is to remake an entire BASIC Interpreter working on a <pink>CLI (command-line interface)</pink>. This project is written on Linux (and partially on Windows) and is designed to work on a Linux terminal.
                <br>The interpreter is supposed to work like <pink>80s computers</pink> (with the 10, 20, 30, etc.) 
                
                <h1><pink>FEATURES</pink></h1>

                <h3>Retro 80s style interpreter</h3>
                As it's purpose is, the MicrowaveBASIC Interpreter is supposed to work like a 80s micro-computer BASIC Interpreter. That means you will type your code in the interpreter like this :
                
                <div class="code">
                    10 P "Hello, World!"<br>
                    20 G 10<br>
                    RUN
                </div>

                <h3>Fully written from scratch</h3>
                The entire code is written in C++ and <pink>from scratch</pink>. Nothing of the source code (except one utils.cpp function) has been copied from other websites.<br>
                The entire code including the string, math and condition expression system, the engine and the interpreter has been entirely coded by me.

                <h3>Simple expression system... probably too simple</h3>
                Writing conditions and expressions with MicrowaveBASIC is simple but also very limited. (that's a con)<br>
                <div class="code">
                    // GOOD
                    <br>IF A=1:P "A = 1"
                    <br>// BAD
                    <br>IF A==1:P "A = 1"
                    <br>
                    <br>// GOOD
                    <br>=* A 1+2-3
                    <br>// BAD (does not support parentheses)
                    <br>=* A (1+2)-3 
                </div>

                Yea... It doesn't support parentesis and you can only use + - * / operators<br>
                Same for strings, very limited, you can only add strings<br><br>
                But <pink>no worries!</pink> I am planning to rewrite the expression system!
